# Amazon-Clone

I built a responsive Amazon Clone web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project features:

• A dynamic product listing with category filters and pagination.<br>
• Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations when navigating between pages.<br>
• A fully functional shopping cart with local storage persistence.<br>
• Product detail modals and a modern, mobile-friendly UI.<br>
• “Back to Top” and interactive navigation elements

This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, especially in DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating a seamless user experience.
